# Hotel Management System

The Hotel Management System is a console-based application developed to manage basic hotel operations such as customer registration, room booking, check-in, and check-out.

This project was developed for academic purposes and demonstrates both programming fundamentals and the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

---

## Project Objectives

The objectives of this project are to:

- Automate basic hotel management operations  
- Reduce manual record keeping  
- Apply programming concepts to solve real-world problems  
- Demonstrate understanding of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)  
- Produce a well-documented software project  

---

## Features

- Add customer details  
- Book hotel rooms  
- View customer and room records  
- Check-in customers  
- Check-out customers  
- Menu-driven and user-friendly interface  

---

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: C++ / Python *(depending on implementation)*  
- IDE: Code::Blocks / Visual Studio Code  
- Version Control: GitHub

# 🔄 Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a systematic process used to plan, design, develop, test, deploy, and maintain software applications.  
This Hotel Management System was developed by following all SDLC phases to ensure clarity, correctness, and maintainability.

## 1️⃣ Requirement Analysis

This phase involved carefully studying the problem and identifying what the Hotel Management System is expected to do.

### Activities Performed:
- Identified the need to replace manual hotel record keeping
- Studied basic hotel operations such as customer registration, room booking, check-in, and check-out
- Determined system limitations such as console-based interaction

### Functional Requirements:
- The system should allow entry of customer details  
- The system should allow booking of available rooms  
- The system should handle customer check-in and check-out  
- The system should display customer and room records  
- The system should provide a clear, menu-driven interface  

### Non-Functional Requirements:
- The system should be easy to use  
- The system should respond quickly to user input  
- The system should be reliable and error-free  
- The system should be simple to maintain and modify  

---

## 2️⃣ System Design

In this phase, the structure and behavior of the system were planned before coding began.

### Design Activities:
- Designed a menu-driven flow for user interaction
- Divided the system into modules such as:
  - Customer management
  - Room booking
  - Check-in and check-out
- Selected appropriate data structures (arrays, lists, structures, or classes)
- Designed function flow and data handling logic

### Design Decisions:
- A console-based interface was chosen for simplicity
- Modular programming was adopted to improve readability
- Input validation was included to reduce errors
- Logical separation of tasks was ensured

---

## 3️⃣ Implementation (Coding)

This phase involved converting the system design into actual program code.

### Implementation Details:
- Each hotel operation was implemented using separate functions
- Conditional statements were used for menu selection
- Loops were used to allow continuous program execution until exit
- Variables were properly named to improve code readability
- Code was written following basic programming best practices

---

## 4️⃣ Testing

Testing was carried out to ensure that the system works as expected and meets the defined requirements.

### Testing Methods Used:
- Manual testing of each menu option
- Testing with valid and invalid inputs
- Boundary testing for room limits and customer data
- Repeated execution to ensure system stability

### Testing Outcomes:
- Verified correct room booking functionality
- Confirmed accurate storage and display of customer data
- Ensured proper check-in and check-out processes
- Confirmed graceful handling of incorrect inputs

---

## 5️⃣ Deployment

After successful testing, the system was made available for use.

### Deployment Process:
- The program was executed successfully in the development environment
- Final source code was reviewed and cleaned
- The project was uploaded to GitHub
- The repository was made public for academic evaluation and submission

---

## 6️⃣ Maintenance

Maintenance involves ongoing improvement of the system after deployment.

### Maintenance Activities:
- Fixing bugs discovered during usage
- Improving performance and efficiency
- Adding new features such as data persistence
- Refactoring code for better structure and readability
- Updating documentation when changes are made
