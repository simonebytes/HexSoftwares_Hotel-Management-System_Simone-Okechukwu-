# 🏨 Hotel Management System

The Hotel Management System is a console-based application developed to manage basic hotel operations such as customer registration, room booking, check-in, and check-out.

This project was developed for academic purposes and demonstrates both programming fundamentals and the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

# 🔄 Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

This project was developed following the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), which is a structured process used to design, develop, test, and maintain software systems.

---

## 1️⃣ Requirement Analysis

In this phase, the problem was analyzed to understand what the system is expected to achieve.

### Identified Requirements:
- The system should store customer information  
- The system should support room booking  
- The system should handle customer check-in and check-out  
- The system should display hotel and customer records  
- The system should be simple, menu-driven, and easy to use  

---

## 2️⃣ System Design

This phase focused on planning how the system would work before coding began.

### Design Decisions:
- A console-based, menu-driven interface was selected  
- Functions were used to separate different hotel operations  
- Data structures such as arrays, lists, or structures were chosen to store data  
- Input validation was considered to prevent invalid user input  

---

## 3️⃣ Implementation (Coding)

In this phase, the actual program was written based on the system design.

### Implementation Details:
- Each hotel operation was implemented as a separate function  
- Conditional statements were used for menu selection  
- Loops were used to keep the program running until the user exits  
- Clear variable names and readable code structure were maintained  

---

## 4️⃣ Testing

The system was tested to ensure that all functionalities worked correctly.

### Testing Activities:
- Tested customer registration  
- Verified room booking functionality  
- Tested check-in and check-out processes  
- Checked system response to invalid inputs  
- Ensured proper program termination  

---

## 5️⃣ Deployment

After successful testing, the system was deployed for use.

### Deployment Steps:
- The program was run successfully in the development environment  
- The source code was uploaded to GitHub  
- The repository was made available for academic evaluation  

---

## 6️⃣ Maintenance

This phase involves updating and improving the system after deployment.

### Maintenance Activities:
- Fixing bugs discovered after deployment  
- Improving system performance  
- Adding new features  
- Refactoring code for better readability and maintenance
